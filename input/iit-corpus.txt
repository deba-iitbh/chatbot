After the nominal duration of the program, current fee of the program at that time will be applicable.

IIT Bhilai may also offer courses to non-degree (exchange) students. A non-degree student is a student who is registered for a degree in a recognized Institute (other than IIT Bhilai) or a University in India or abroad, and who is officially sponsored by that Institute or University to complete a part of her/his academic program at IIT Bhilai. For that purpose, the non-degree student may carry out research, take courses for credit or otherwise, or may use other academic facilities at IIT Bhilai. An official transcript of work done at IIT Bhilai, along with grades obtained, if any, would be given to the non-degree student for her/his use as s/he may deem appropriate. However, any credits earned at the Institute, by a non-degree student, cannot be counted towards any degree program of IIT Bhilai at any time.

A person will be admitted as a non-degree student on the basis of an application to the Dean of Academic Affairs, who will recommend for such admissions along with the recommendations of the concerned DUGC/DPGC for the approval of the Chairperson Senate. The Chairperson&#39;s decision will be final in this regard. An exchange student may be admitted for a maximum period of one year only. The strength of non-degree students in any program shall not exceed 5% of the approved strength of the program in each discipline.

A non-degree student will be required to pay all applicable fees depending upon the status, program and nationality. Students so admitted will be governed by all conduct rules and regulations of IIT Bhilai.
The Institute reserves the right to cancel the admission of any student, and ask him/her to discontinue his/her studies at any stage of his/her career on grounds of indiscipline or inadequate academic performance.
Validity of Admission and Its Cancellation:
All students admitted provisionally or otherwise to any program shall submit copies of their mark-sheets, provisional certificates, etc. of the qualifying examination and other documents by the last date specified for the purpose in the Academic Calendar.

★ Salient features of IIT Bhilai
The campus of IIT Bhilai is expected to be a model case study for the country as a whole. It is therefore designed to be a smart eco-campus and emphasizes sustainability and environmental sensitivity at all levels. Its pattern is driven by stewarding natural resources and based on renewable energy. This campus is designed to function 24x7, for all 365 days of the year
Retention of existing nature &amp; Afforestation:
The master plan and green buildings are designed in such a manner to respect the natural features of the allotted space by retaining most of the existing trees and ponds. The total number of trees on the allotted land has approximately 3,100 trees of native species and IIT Bhilai has planned to plant 12,500 new trees.
Energy efficient campus:
In order to take advantage of the building rooftops for green energy generation and to emphasize the use of renewable energy on the campus, rooftop solar panels are being installed. To optimize the consumption of electricity, 100% LED lights are being used with the power control automation IT tool called “Campus Management System (CMS)”. Also, Air Conditioning requirements were planned to be reduced by the designed orientation of buildings, allowing natural wind flow to keep buildings cool and using insulating walls to prevent heat ingestion. 
Sustainable Water &amp; Waste Management:
From a sustainability viewpoint, domestic water management, wastewater management, sewerage and stormwater management is exceptionally designed on the campus with Zero water discharge and reuse of treated waste water for flushing, horticulture and air conditioning (cooling system) which will result in a very little water demand from external sources. Rainwater is harvested to meet a large chunk of our water requirement. Waste management is planned campus-wide by segregating decomposable and non-decomposable waste and use of waste digesters to convert waste to manure.
Unique Access Corridor:
A unique corridor is being constructed in the academic zone of the campus connecting all the academic buildings. The sides of the access corridor will be embellished with panels containing nature-inspired themes by Gond Artwork depicting the rich history of incredible Chhattisgarh.
Well Planned expansion of the campus:
In the phase-wise construction, buildings are planned and designed to avoid vertical expansion in the future. Horizontal expansion is planned to cause the least disturbance to the existing buildings.
★ Recognition of IIT Bhilai Permanent campus (Construction)
The campus of IIT Bhilai is designed with a vision that the generations of students who study and graduate from IIT Bhilai will experience, appreciate and implement the value of nature, sustainability and the joy of living together with nature.

  Research Interest 
I work broadly in the area of networks and wireless systems. Currently, my focus is on next generation of wireless standards (5G/6G, IEEE 802.11ax/be) specifically on coexistence and convergence of different radio access technologies. I also actively work in the area of Software-Defined Networks (SDN) and Non-Terrestrial Networks (NTN). I obtained my PhD from IIT Hyderabad where my focus was on employing novel coexistence schemes in LTE-U/LAA and Wi-Fi Networks for efficient utilization of unlicensed spectrum.

About IIT Bhilai
Indian Institute of Technology Bhilai is one of the youngest IIT and is established in the state of Chhattisgarh by the Ministry of Human Resource and Development (GoI) in the year 2016. The concept of Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) as Centres of Academic Excellence evolved from the vision of Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru to produce world leaders in technology and innovation from India to serve the nation. IITs are centrally funded, autonomous institutes which provide overall personality development of the students in all frames of life. The first IIT was established in 1951 at Kharagpur in West Bengal. Since then, with the growing demand several IITs have been established at regular intervals of time. Presently, there are 23 IITs across the nation. 
IIT Bhilai is presently functioning from its transit campus at Government Engineering College (GEC) Raipur. The transit campus is about 10 kms from the main city of Raipur and is well connected through public transport to the railway station, airport, and Raipur City.
Campus life
IIT Bhilai, despite being recently established, has provided ample opportunities to its students to excel both in academics and extracurricular activities. The institute has introduced the fractal academic programme, which fosters an environment of interdisciplinary learning (To know more about the academic structure

). 
The students are provided with well-equipped laboratories and a resourceful central library, which help them acquire holistic education. However, they are also encouraged to look beyond the classroom environment and participate wholeheartedly in the vibrant life of the student community on campus. 
Council of Student Affairs (CoSA) is the student body, which actively conducts and manages student related activities of IIT Bhilai. CoSA coordinates various clubs on campus, which provide the students with the opportunities to hone their skills in dance, music, theatre, oratory, creative writing, art, and photography. Apart from these general interest clubs, the students can also become members of technical clubs dedicated to electronics components, coding, robotics, and space exploration. The campus is buzzing with the activities, which these clubs conduct on a regular basis. National Service Scheme (NSS) activities are also held frequently on campus where the students are encouraged to provide voluntary community service. The students of IIT Bhilai have also proved their mettle in sports by participating and winning laurels in events such as Inter-IIT Sports Meet. Thus, IIT Bhilai boast of a strong student community equally competent in academics, cultural activities and sports.

Abstract
: This paper presents a design technique to realize fractional order (FO) immittance in the second quadrant of the impedance plane, using Bruton’s generalized immittance converter (GIC). Design guidelines are developed based on a sub-optimal analysis of phase error resulted by non-ideal op amps. The analysis takes into account finite open-loop dc gain and finite unity-gain frequency of practical op amps and aim to maximize the constant phase zone for a given phase band specification. The fractance of the realized fractor can also be tuned to a desired value by varying one of the GIC resistances. Several simulations and experimental validations are demonstrated. Also, high Q, FO bandpass filter with wide tuning range is presented as an application of the designed obtuse angle fractor.

Abstract
: This paper presents fabrication and characterization of fractors or fractional order (FO) elements with wide constant phase zones (100 mHz – 100 kHz). They are realized with carbon nanotube (CNT) and polyimide composite coated electrodes and ionic gels. A thorough study has been carried out on variations of their electrical parameters with respect to device composition, time and temperature. A hermetically sealed packaging scheme has been developed which has made the fractors readily integrable with PCB as well as helped to achieve an average shelf-life of two years. The phase characteristics of CNT fractors are less ripply and less noisy than their equivalent ladder fractors. A FO resonator and an arbitrary attenuation high pass filter have been designed with the fabricated fractor to demonstrate its applicability in practical analogue circuits.

Abstract
: This paper presents Foster I and Foster II realizations of fractors using RC ladders while meeting five different specifications together, i.e., exponent, coefficients, upper and lower limits of constant phase zone, and phase band. The work mainly focusses on achieving the specified phase band to circumvent the present limitation of state-of-the-art. A comparison among the proposed algorithm and existing algorithms of fractor realization highlights the benefits of the proposed one. Furthermore, effects of tolerance limits of resistances (R) and capacitances (C) on the values of the fractor parameters are studied via Monte Carlo simulation using PSpice. Based on that, it develops suitable algorithm to choose R and C elements in practice. A set of experimental results are presented at the end to substantiate the presented guidelines and simulation results.

An Impedimetric Cu-Polymer Sensor-Based Conductivity Meter for Precision Agriculture and Aquaculture Applications

Abstract
: This paper presents a two-electrode type conductivity sensor, using copper as electrodes, coated with a polyimide layer called DQN-60. This sensor is specially designed to be robust yet inexpensive for applications like precision farming and fishery. A new conductivity sensing principle is proposed which is based on impedimetric measurement (both magnitude and phase) at a frequency of 200 kHz. This sensing principle is developed by analyzing the electrical equivalent model of the proposed sensor and is aimed at eliminating the effect of the interface impedance and the cell capacitance thus making the measurement linear and accurate. A prototype meter is developed with 3.75% maximum full-scale error in the range of 0.5 microS/cm to 20 mS/cm. The temperature compensation, calibration, and detailed experimental results are also discussed.

Abstract
: This paper addresses the issue of the optimal design of a grounded fractional order inductor using a generalized impedance converter. The nonidealities of the op amps have been taken into account while formulating the approximate 
frequency characteristics of the fractional order inductor for both Type-I and Type-II realizations. Based on these formulations a set of design guidelines is proposed to achieve minimum phase and magnitude errors for the realized fractional inductor. 
The minimization conditions have been validated by several simulation and experimental results.

Abstract
: This paper presents the design and realization of a tunable fractional-order series resonator. It is made of an acute-angled capacitive fractor and an obtuse-angled inductive fractor and has theoretically infinite quality factor. This work establishes a 
relation between resonating frequency and fractor&#39;s coefficients, and that makes the tuning of such resonator feasible in practice. Similar work, by same authors, already exists for fractional-order parallel resonator. The present work along with the said parallel resonator 
completes the study on tunable fractional-order resonator. The fractional-order series resonator, proposed here, is realized in hardware, tuned at various frequencies, and shows very high quality fractor (about 350). The paper also goes through detailed sensitivity analysis 
of the proposed resonator as well as discusses the practical aspects of proposed tuning in detail.

Abstract
: This paper introduces a tunable fractional order parallel resonator (FOPR) whose resonating frequency can be tuned by the coefficient of a fractional order (FO) element (fractor). At the same time, its Q-factor can be set very high (theoretically infinite) by varying its resistor. 
Using this FOPR circuit, two simple FO filters (FO bandpass and FO notch) are also developed. The paper includes detail sensitivity analyses of these circuits for various circuit parameters and describes how different design parameters of proposed FOPR and FO filters are chosen accordingly.
Proposed FOPR and FO filters are simulated in MATLAB and realized in hardware. The hardware circuits are tested practically, and detail experimental results are provided. It is found that the experimental data are in good agreement with the simulation data. In hardware, 
the realized FOPR has achieved a Q-factor up to 360, and the realized FO notch filter.

Design and performance study of dynamic fractors in any of the four quadrants

Abstract
: A fractor is a simple fractional-order system. Its transfer function is 1/Fs^α; the coefficient, F, is called the fractance, and α is called the exponent of the fractor. This paper presents how a fractor can be realized, using RC ladder circuit, 
meeting the predefined specifications on both F and α. Besides, commonly reported fractors have between 0 and 1. So, their constant phase angles (CPA) are always restricted between 0 and -90 degree. This work has employed GIC topology to realize fractors from any of 
the four quadrants, which means fractors with  between 2 and +2. Hence, one can achieve any desired CPA between -180 degree and +180 degree. The paper also exhibits how these GIC parameters can be used to tune the fractance of emulated fractors in real time, thus realizing 
dynamic fractors. In this work, a number of fractors are developed as per proposed technique and their impedance characteristics are studied.

Orientation Program 2020 for BTech students
IIT Bhilai organised a four-day orientation program for its new batch of BTech students, from November 18 to 21. Keeping the COVID-19 advisories in mind, the orientation program along with the registration process was held entirely online. 
The program was organised in such a way as to familiarize the students with the institute’s academic programs and facilities. The four days were packed with plenty of virtual interaction between incoming students, faculty members, and existing students of IIT Bhilai. Dedicated sessions gave students and their parents a chance to interact with the Director, the Deans of Student and Academic Affairs, CoSA President and faculty members from across departments.
While welcoming the students, the Director of IIT Bhilai, Prof Rajat Moona announced that following the protocol that education must not stall, the institute is now well-equipped to handle the ongoing COVID-19 crisis. At the same time, since the health and safety of students, faculty members, and staff are of the highest priority, education would continue online for the coming semester. 
Students were told about the various attributes and functions of online education and how best to manage their courses from off-campus. Faculty members from all departments outlined the courses that were on offer, encouraging the students to take an active part in all the academic activities that the institute has in store. Students were also informed about their newly designed timetables and the students’ life at the institute.
This year, the orientation was all the more special since the new students had the chance to also interact with the pioneer batch of the institute who shared their fruitful experience at IIT Bhilai. Various icebreaking online activities such as Fun Quiz and Meme competitions were also organised by the student mentors so that freshers can better correspond among themselves and learn how to communicate with faculty members and senior students.

IIT Bhilai and CDSL Venture Limited (CVL) Sign Service Level Agreement (SLA) for lodging academic awards in National Academic Depository (NAD) Portal
Indian Institute of Technology Bhilai (IIT Bhilai) and CDSL Venture Limited (CVL) signed a Service Level Agreement (SLA) on 30th August 2019 for lodging academic awards of students from the current academic year in National Academic Depository (NAD) Portal. This SLA would be of immense benefit to the students as now, certificate/degrees, mark sheets, etc would be available with just a click of mouse. This would also help the companies across the world to verify the certificates of our students for authenticity, thereby curbing the issues related to fake certificates.
The National Academic Depository (NAD) has been established in the year of 2016 to ensure a 24 x 7 digital and safe electronic store house of all academic awards viz. certificates, degrees, mark sheets, etc. It allows the academic Institutions to lodge and upload the academic awards which are authenticated and validated.

IIT Bhilai was established in 2016 with three UG specializations, i.e., BTech in Mechanical Engineering (ME), BTech in Electrical Engineering (EE) and BTech in Computer Science and Engineering (CSE).  The department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science (EECS) was formed at IIT Bhilai in April 2018 by merging the departments of Computer Science and Engineering and Electrical Engineering. 
With the rise of Cloud Computing, Internet of Things, and Web 3.0, amount of data being produced and captured by computer systems and applications is ever increasing at an exponential rate. To harbour the opportunity and challenge to develop the next generation technologies to store, manage, analyze, share and understand the huge volume of data that is generated in business, the third discipline on Data Science and Artificial Intelligence (DSAI) was lunched in the year 2020. Initially, B.Tech program was offered under DSAI starting from the year 2020, followed MTech and PhD programs from the year 2021. 
The department has state of the art facilities in the following verticals covering the spectrum of Electrical and Computing Sciences.  
Computer Systems
High Performance Computing and GPU
Devices and Circuits

About 
The Department of Liberal Arts was established 
at IIT Bhilai on the basis that true interdisciplinarity may best be achieved in an institution 
which has a firm grasp of applied and social sciences. The freedom engendered by this combination 
helps create the ideal environment for advanced research and cutting-edge pedagogy, where new 
areas can be explored and further disseminated.
Presently, the Department of Liberal Arts has faculty members 
specializing in the fields of Psychology, Economics, Literature and Cultural Studies. The courses offered 
by the department at the B.Tech. and PhD levels encourage exploration and learning across these disciplines. 
The diverse range of topics help students to question the history of ideas, and to think creatively and 
critically about the world through the major developments in the humanities and the arts. A visiting 
language-instructor from Taiwan also offers courses in Mandarin, which, together with the bouquet of 
communication courses, equips students with the key skills required to express themselves in the academic 
and corporate spheres.
In the years to come, the Department of Liberal Arts seeks 
to become a centre for research and excellence where the pressing concerns and developments in the field of 
humanities and social sciences are studied and disseminated in the local, national, and global contexts. It aims 
to build inter-institutional ties and collaborations of far-reaching impact by extending its expertise and 
spearheading research initiatives.

Cultural Studies
Cultural studies views culture through meanings and values gleaned from everyday lived processes, rather than seeing it as that which is linked to the past through monuments, scriptures, arts etc. It broadly engages with cultural institutions and productions in a social and political context. Its interdisciplinary linkage to English departments is made evident in its deployment of literary and critical theory to the study of cultural phenomena. At the moment, our research in this area is focused on various popular cultural formations, including literature, film, advertising, sport and internet cultures. We will look to expand within as well as beyond these topics in the future.

Sports Studies
While a new and burgeoning area of research, sports studies has largely remained aligned to the disciplines of history and sociology in India. The presence of sport in Indian social life and popular culture cannot be understated. From local parks to film and television, sport is ubiquitous. It stands to reason that Indian cultural studies should take note of this neglected area of study. In line with this, we deploy the lens of cultural studies to examine sport with respect to representation, commodification, the sports-media complex, celebrity, fandom, and literature, in an attempt to add to the cultural history of sport in India.

Political Economics
At the intersection of economics and political science, Political Economics as a subfield of economics has two aspects to it. Macro political economics deals with political determinants of economic growth and development, politics of public finance, political underpinnings of international trade and finance outcomes, economic determinants and effects of political institutions and outcomes. Micro political economics studies economics of corruption and governance, micro-dynamics of public policies and welfare programs, and the theory and empirics of elections and voting. Modern political economics is aided by sound microeconomic and macroeconomic theories as well as various state-of-the-art statistical and econometric methods deployed on various kinds of datasets such as administrative and survey data. Political economics enlightens us with both big and small but important questions that underlie the role of politics in determining economic and political outcomes.

Development Economics
Development Economics is a broad sub-field of economics. It encompasses both macroeconomic and microeconomic issues related to poverty and inequality, unemployment, healthcare, agriculture, labour markets, public finance, international trade, innovation and ICT, financial inclusion etc. This research cluster mainly focuses on the subfields of economics of poverty and inequality, economic growth, health economics, and education economics. We focus on regional differences in poverty and inequality incidence, and their political-institutional and economic drivers. We also study sub-regional comparative growth and development, and factors explaining differences in growth outcomes. The theme of health economics entails exploring issues pertaining to health behaviours, health insurance, health financing, health inequality, physicians, health policy, industrial organization of health (pharmaceutical and hospitals), interplay between environment and health, impact of public finance policies on healthcare. As part of the sub-theme of economics of education, we explore various themes of quality of education, exams and outcomes, returns to education, schooling, teacher quality, public policies to address education production function problems, education financing, higher education issues. These topics are merely indicative.

Labour Economics
Labour Economics is an important subfield of economics. In this discipline, we explore and research current issues in the Indian labour market such as those pertaining to labour supply, labour demand, labour market equilibrium, wage structure, returns to education, compensating wage differentials, human capital, labour mobility, labour market discrimination, unemployment, labour unions, labour market regulation. Several sub-fields that have their roots in labour economics such as economics of family and marriage markets, economics of education, economics of discrimination and economics of poverty and inequality have in recent decades become independent stand-alone fields within the epistemic discipline of economics.

Positive Organizational Behaviour
When the positive psychology lens is applied to the organizational domain, it gives rise to positive organizational behaviour. This field tries to enhance organizational performance and  employee well-being. This is achieved through the scientific study of positively valued subjective experiences, personal traits and civic virtues in the workplace by harnessing their potential to improve the work related well-being. Cross-cultural work experiences also form part of these investigations. 
Members:

Positive Psychology
Positive psychology studies human strengths with the ultimate aim of increasing well-being. This is opposed to the previously dominant paradigm of healing and repairing symptoms of disorders that focussed more on human deficits. Within this field, research is conducted on the topics of positive psychology interventions, character strengths of gratitude and humour, well-being, flow, positive health and mental health.  Helping people achieve better health and overall well-being is the prime motive.

Urban Studies
The pace and scale of urbanization in our times has necessitated critical reflections and course corrections in a wide range of domains. Planning, housing, governance, infrastructure, waste management, livelihood, heritage, these are only some of the key thematics which are attracting contextual, evidence-based, intersectional research on our cities. In India as well as the Global South at large, cities present very tangible opportunities for careful policy interventions and dialogues by scholars in contributing to and transforming the paradigms of our ongoing urbanisation. Focussing primarily but not exclusively on urban planning, history, heritage, and writing, we are looking to build a corpus of scholarship located in and speaking to shared issues and perspectives of the Global South.

Victorian Studies
The long nineteenth century has been researched and spoken about extensively, but the recent material turn in Victorian scholarship has opened exciting new avenues for further research. What was the footprint of British colonial and imperial rule on Indian life? How did interaction with South Asia and its denizens contribute to the formation of British selfhood? Was metropolitan life constituted, vitally, by the inevitable depth and reach of colonised cultures? How were these processes and encounters written about and portrayed in literature and art of the time? These are some of the questions which we are interested in examining, to generate more layered understandings of colonialism and its wide-ranging, mutually constitutive impact on metropolitan and subcontinental life and culture.

Activities
The department organizes seminars and colloquia from time to time, and there is a regular journal club in which all the members of the department (students, research staff and faculty) participate, and discuss new research and ideas. Apart from that, there are other informal scientific activities as well e.g. quantum society, physics club-like bigger forums and multiple smaller forums. We are engaged in the outreach activities to introduce the exciting research being done to the general public. We are constantly looking for new avenues to interact with the general public and nearby schools to encourage youngsters towards fundamental and applied physics. The department also encourages the prospective students to apply for summer internships. The faculty members have been supervising the internships from past couple of years, to train the young minds in frontier research techniques.

Astrophysics and Cosmology
Astrophysics applies the laws of physics to study astronomical objects such as planets, stars and galaxies. Cosmology is the study of the origin and evolution of the Universe as a whole. Our research in this area is focussed on: (1) Formation and evolution of galaxies (2) Reionization (3) The Milky Way and metal poor stars (4) Astrophysical fluid dynamics.
Galaxies serve as laboratories for our research, and they are the building blocks of the Universe. Understanding their formation and their impact on the ionization state of the Universe are unsolved problems that are a focus of study for powerful telescopes such as the Hubble and the JWST. We are investigating the formation of galaxies analytically as well as with the state of the art cosmological N-body simulations such as EAGLE. We also collaborate with VIRGO consortium, ASTRO-3D and with observational astronomers worldwide who use powerful radio telescopes (e.g. MWA and SKA) to look at the epoch when first stars and galaxies were formed.

Condensed Matter Experiment
The Thin-Film and Photovoltaics Group (TPG) focuses on the basic understanding of thin-film growth and techniques by which their electro-optical properties can be tailored according to the target application. The acquired knowledge is then applied in energy-efficient devices such as organic light emitting diodes (OLEDs), transistors and photovoltaic cells to make them inexpensive, reliable and energy-efficient.

Properties and applications of nanostructures highly depend on their structural properties. For many applications like plasmonic sensing, optical coatings, and colloidal experiments etc. a precise control on the structural properties is crucial. Active Micro and Nanosystems (AMN) group explores the advanced techniques like Glancing Angle Deposition (GLAD) in combination with lithography and Langmuir-Blodgett methods to fabricate the designer nanostructures with precise control on shape, size and material structure of sizes down to sub 100 nm.

Ultrafast spectroscopy group explores hybrids of TMDCs and other 2D materials, which offer rather exciting properties. Since, the efficiency of hybrid photonic devices depends on the life-time of the excited carriers, we focus on unfolding the fundamental time-scales, thereby determining the electronic and optical coupling across the interface. We also employ photoelectron spectroscopy to unveil the electronic band structure and band alignment.

Condensed Matter Theory
Computational physics is one of the core-areas of fundamental and applied research. We have been exploring this domain on hybrids of 2D materials due to their excellent applicability in various domains. We use first-principle density functional theory to calculate the band structure and other optical properties. We employ VESTA and XCrysDen to model our system and Quantum Espresso for calculations.

High Energy Physics 
Even after spectacular successes of Standard Model (SM) of particle physics, the theory has been crippled with certain theoretical questions like baryon asymmetry of the universe, dark matter, dark energy and some experimental findings like non-zero neutrino mass and mixing etc to which it awaits further theoretical formulation.The group at IIT Bhilai, within the purview of Particle Physics and Astroparticle Physics, is interested in understanding the new physics beyond the Standard Model, which includes gauge theory of leptons and baryons, left-right symmetric models, Pati-Salam theory of SU(4) color and grand unified theories (SO(10), E6 GUTs) in the context of testable neutrino mass generation mechanisms, LNV, LFV, neutrinoless double beta decay, proton decay, dark matter, matter-antimatter asymmetry of the Universe and Large Hadron Collider (LHC) prospects. The focus is, also, to use the neutrino portal as a beacon to explore the new physics beyond the SM  through a synergetic exploration at three interrelated frontiers of particle physics, namely, the Energy, Intensity and Cosmic Frontiers.

Dr. Sudhanwa Patra
Quark Gluon Plasma is a deconfined phase of nuclear matter, which can be produced in laboratories of heavy ion collision experiments like RHIC (at BNL, USA) and LHC (at CERN, Switzerland). One of the theoretical groups in IIT Bhilai works on this topic, where they have used different mathematical frameworks, based on Quantum Field Theory at finite temperature, Statistical mechanics, Fluid dynamics of relativistic particles etc.

Soft Matter Physics
Soft condensed matter is a relatively new discipline in the interface between physics, chemistry and biology. It refers to the study of the materials that are easily deformed by thermal fluctuations and external forces. At IIT Bhilai, the Active Micro and Nanosystems (AMN) group is interested in experimental study of soft matter physics which includes the active matter, micro-nanorobots and nanomotors, self-assembly of colloids, and active rheological fluids etc. In addition to the development of these new materials the group is also interested in understanding the physics of biological systems using experimental models and concepts of the soft matter physics.

Recent Advances on Developing Sustainable Energy Solutions at IIT Bhilai
Harvesting energy effectively is one of the biggest challenges that we face for protecting the future of our planet. Researchers from around the world have been attracted to renewable energy and are on a spree to tap solar and wind power to fulfill the demand of the market. Joining this cause researchers at IIT Bhilai are continuously working towards developing sustainable energy solutions. Two projects are being undertaken in the field for the development of solar cells based on perovskite material, a highly efficient emerging photovoltaic technology.
Perovskite solar cells can convert light into electricity and are potentially cheaper and simpler to produce than traditional silicon-based solar cells. Also, these materials have demonstrated better efficiency levels. Scientists began to study these crystal structures for use in solar cells only about a decade ago and have rapidly increased their solar energy conversion efficiency. Whereas traditional silicon solar cells are produced with precise processes using high temperatures, perovskites can be made using room-temperature chemical solutions.
PhD scholars working in the thin-film photovoltaic lab 
Dr. Dhriti Sundar Ghosh (Asst Prof, Physics) along with Dr. Sanjib Banerjee (Asst Prof, Chemistry), Dr. Nikhil Chander (Asst Prof, Electrical Engineering and Computer Science), Dr. Satyajit Gupta (Asst Prof, Chemistry) and Dr. Soumya Gangopadhyay (Assoc Prof, Mechanical Engineering) are working towards the development of large-area, stable perovskite solar cells. This project is funded by the Department of Science and Technology (DST) under the Nanomission scheme and has a project value of 138 Lakhs. 
“Due to the growing population, the global energy demand is increasing year by year. The recent progress in materials processing and engineering of highly efficient and stable solar cells will emerge as a frontline renewable energy technology,” said Dr Dhriti Sundar Ghosh, the project lead.
In addition, other projects being carried out individually by Dr Ghosh aims to develop semi-transparent perovskite solar cells for building window applications. Semi-transparent photovoltaic (ST-PV) technologies can be applied to replace facades and roofs in conventional buildings and coatings on vehicles to produce energy from sunlight.  By utilizing transparent electrodes, semitransparent perovskite solar cell (ST‐PSC) could be extensively utilized as solar windscreen. This project is sponsored by Science and Engineering Research Board (SERB) under the Early Career Research Award (ECRA) scheme and is worth 55.77 Lakhs. There is another project being led by Dr. Ghosh is about developing novel transparent electrodes for solar cells, i.e., materials which are transparent as well as electrically conductive at the same time. This project is funded by SERB and is worth 35 Lakhs. To facilitate this a thin-film photovoltaic lab (www.thinpvlab.in) has been established at IIT Bhilai to carry out the research of these projects and work is undergoing in full flow to achieve the goals of the project.
Very recently, the group demonstrated an ultrathin (5nm), inexpensive material which can be used in perovskite solar cells achieving a similar level of efficiency. This copper metal-based material is about 250 times lower in cost than the conventionally used material and is abundantly available. The group have achieved ~15% efficient solar cell here at the laboratory. The group plans to check the real-time performance of the developed solar cells in the highly demanding condition outdoors in Raipur, CG. The results recently got published in a reputed journal Solar Energy.

Nanoscale devices for emerging technologies 
Dr. K. L. Ganapathi  (IIT Madras) 
Friday, 27 Aug 2021, 3 pm to 4 pm 
Abstract:
Understanding the physics of nanoscale devices and related material properties  are essential requirements to sustain the existing technologies and also to develop next-generation technologies. In recent times, low power devices have become the need of the hour. However, fundamental physical limits are among the major roadblocks towards realizing energy-efficient devices. In this talk, I will discuss one of the fundamental physical limits in silicon transistors, termed  Boltzmann Tyranny, which needs to be overcome to achieve low power devices.  I will discuss the details of the problem and various approaches to solve it  through an understanding of the device physics and also by integrating new materials using advanced nanofabrication techniques. Further, I will discuss the  development of ferroelectric non-volatile memory using 2D semiconductors.  I will also briefly discuss some of the research work done on optoelectronic devices including UV and broadband photodetectors as well as random lasers.  Finally, I will discuss key requisites of nanofabrication and of device physics  which are crucial for the successful development of quantum devices and  related technologies.
Thursday Colloquium Series
Twistronics: A Recent Avenue in van der Waals Heterostructures
The inaugural seminar of the Thursday Colloquium Series organized by the Department of Physics, IIT Bhilai was held on September 24, 2020.  Dr. Pramoda Kumar Nayak, an expert on two dimensional (2D) material from IIT Madras, spoke on “Twistronics: A Recent Avenue in van der Waals Heterostructures”.
During the seminar, Dr. Nayak discussed that after the discovery of graphene, the most prominent representative class of two-dimensional (2D) layered materials, many other 2D crystals have been identified, often with intriguing properties that have no counterparts in three-dimensional solids. Such 2D materials own various interesting and unexpected properties; for instance, the stacking of such layers leads to ‘artificial vdW solids’ called as van der Waals heterostructures (vdW HSs) that result in the emergence of new states of matter with novel functionalities.The vdW HSs not only depend on the combination of different 2D crystal but also on their rotational alignment opening the avenue for a new field called twistronics. Coupling between the two layers depends on the stacking angle, which can be used as an external degree of freedom to tune their optical and electronic properties. 
In this talk, Dr Nayak covered the atlas of vdW materials and their heterostructures emphasizing on synthesis, characterization and potential applications in electronics and optoelectronics. Additionally, he described how a simple twist can dramatically change the functionalities of vdW HSs, fabricated from 2D monolayers grown by chemical vapor deposition. To conclude, he summarized the current challenges and future opportunities that are available in this emerging field.

IIT Bhilai Fights Against Covid -19: Faculty Members Makes Novel Face Mask and Swab
In this war against novel corona virus (Covid-19), the IIT Bhilai promises to stand by our nation and to fight this war with our fellow citizen with its full capacity and perseverance. Under the abled guidance of director Prof. Rajat Moona, the researchers, faculty members and staffs of IIT Bhilai have dedicated themselves to develop novel technologies to help the medical doctors and the health care personnel. Despite its limited infrastructure and resources in transit campus, Mechanical Engineering Department of IIT Bhilai has designed a unique full face mask which is going to cover complete head instead of only mouth and nose. Therefore, this unique face mask can protect the users’ nose, mouth, eyes and ears also. The mask would be very much beneficial for the doctors and other health care personals who are actually fighting the war at frontline. If these personals got infected that would a huge cost to the society. Therefore, IIT Bhilai proposing the mask as an advanced protection gear for the medical personals. The mask is not a use and throw type mask. It can be washed in soap water after every 4 hours of use. Reusability is the biggest advantage of the mask and it can be prepared for reuse within 30 minute. As it is covering complete head, two N95 compatible filters are attached for sufficient air circulation. Provision is given so that hot and moist air can easily go out during exhale and fresh air can come in for inhale. Further, arrangement for attaching hazmat clothing with the mask will enhance its protection level while removing the mask.  The 3D printed prototype has already been prepared at IIT Bhilai.
Besides this face mask, a first generation nasal test swab has been developed by IIT Bhilai. The swab is fabricated in-house using biocompatible material. It has been conceptualized and designed by the team of Mechanical Engineering Department and visioned by Prof. Rajat Moona, Director IIT Bhilai.
The assembly line production manual for Face Mask Shield is released here as is basis and is available for 
free download.

Mrs Geeta Ghosh-Roy (aka Geeta) and Dr AmalenduBhusan Ghosh-Roy (aka Amal) are the parents of Dr. R. Ghosh-Roy who is providing the funds for this scholarship. The name GeetAmal comes from the combination of my parents&#39; names. My parents worked hard to ensure that their three sons understood the need for good education, despite the financial hardships they had to personally endure. After graduation, I was fortunate enough to receive a scholarship from UK&#39;s Committee of Vice Chancellors and Principals to study at St Andrews University in Scotland. This scholarship paid the university fees. It was beyond my parents&#39; means to pay for the living expenses. The university, fortunately, offered me a second scholarship to pay for my living expenses and thereby removed the financial hurdle. It has been my desire since to set up a scholarship in my parents&#39; name to help students of similar ilk academically and from similar financial background. I have since been fortunate enough to have climbed the career ladder successfully. I therefore feel elated that this scholarship would help bright students to enter a very prestigious institution like IIT Bhilai. Best of luck!

IIT Bhilai permanent campus masterplan receives GRIHA 5-star rating
On the occasion of World Environment Day, the master plan of the main campus of Indian Institute of Technology Bhilai received a 5-star GRIHA rating. GRIHA is an acronym for &#34;Green Rating for Integrated Habitat Assessment&#34;. It is a rating tool that helps to assess the performance of buildings against certain nationally acceptable benchmarks. It evaluates the environmental performance of a building holistically over its entire life cycle, thereby providing a definitive standard for what constitutes a ‘green building’. The rating system, based on accepted energy and environmental principles, seeks to strike a balance between established practices and emerging concepts, both national and international.
The IIT Bhilai permanent campus project has made significant progress over the last few months in terms of construction. The campus has been planned on a sustainable development model, with various green-building features incorporated and integrated within the design itself. Roads with tree-lined avenues and parking lots have been provided and the campus is designed to be pedestrian friendly, encouraging minimal use of vehicles by residents. Green spaces and gardens have been provided to reduce the heat island impact. Within various zones, the circulation system avoids clashes between vehicles, cyclists, pedestrians, and joggers. Through such meticulous planning, IIT Bhilai continues to reiterate its commitment to the environment and preserving the ecosystem.
IIT Bhilai Construction Project wins GRIHA Council Awards
The Indian Institute of Technology Bhilai permanent campus project has made steady progress over the last few months. With respect to the latest onsite development, the structure works of most buildings are now completed. Work is on for installing the essential furniture, network, and audio-visual equipment. 
At a function organized in New Delhi last month, the construction project, which is being handled by the Central Public Works Department (CPWD), won two of GRIHA Council’s ‘Exemplary Performance Awards’. Not only did the project top in the category of ‘Site Management (during construction)’, but it was also ranked one in the category of ‘Construction Workers Health &amp; Safety (during construction)’. With the tireless attention to detail, the construction work has now crossed 9 million safe man-hours. 
Shri Bhupender Yadav, Hon&#39;ble Minister for Environment, Forest &amp; Climate Change and Labour &amp; Employment presented the awards to Shri Rohit Maheshwari, Executive Engineer - IIT Bhilai Project, CPWD during the event. “Recognition of IIT Bhilai project through these awards indicates our endeavour to achieve quality in construction while being mindful for the sustainability and environment”, said Prof Rajat Moona, Director, IIT Bhilai.
With these two awards, IIT Bhilai construction project has received five awards for GRIHA Council, with three awards received last year at the 12th GRIHA Council Summit. GRIHA is a rating tool that helps people assess a building’s performance against nationally acceptable benchmarks. It has been adopted as the national rating system for green buildings by the Ministry of New and Renewable Energy, Govt of India, since 2007. 
Permanent campus architectural design, receives coveted GRIHA awards 
IIT Bhilai campus architectural design, received the GRIHA Exemplary Performance Award in the categories of Passive Architecture Design &amp; Energy Management and was runner up in Integrated Water Management. The award was announced at the 12th GRIHA Summit on December 15-16, 2020 with the theme &#34;Rejuvenating Resilient Habitats”. 
GRIHA is a rating tool that helps assess the performance of buildings against nationally acceptable benchmarks. It evaluates the building’s environmental performance holistically over its entire life cycle, with the rating system based on nationally and internationally accepted energy and environmental principles.
IIT Bhilai’s fully sustainable and energy efficient water-front campus will adhere to the norms required for GRIHA 5-star rating. The state-of-the-art campus will adopt cutting-edge methodologies to reduce disruption and retain natural resources such as water bodies, flora and fauna. The orientation of the buildings as well as the use of insulated walls and glassware will supplement the liveability of the buildings within the existing natural habitat.
The proposed campus will have 100% LED based light fixtures and high efficient electrical equipment to minimize energy consumption. Its rooftop solar panels will generate enough power to meet 30% of its requirement and will further reduce the demand from the grid with the help of Campus Level Building Management System (BMS) integrated with SCADA. The central air conditioning plant will also provide air conditioning to the student hostels at night. 
The campus will have a network of water bodies that will retain overflow during the rainy season. The landscape along these water bodies will form micro climate zones conserving the natural conditions of the locality. In addition, the campus will have net zero water run-off with zero waste discharge and zero sewage discharge. Besides securing the prestigious GRIHA awards, these and other features will ensure that the IIT Bhilai permanent campus becomes a futuristic model for all higher education institutions to come.

1. Why IIT Bhilai is a good institute to study at?
A good institute is the one that meets expectations of its diverse students. Faculty, peers, curriculum and infrastructure are some of the important constituents of an institute. IIT Bhilai has a very talented pool of faculty who are accessible in the classrooms as well as outside the classroom. IIT Bhilai follows a fractal system of academic courses.

Engineering in India: A Brief History of an Aspirational Profession
Monday, 8 February 2021
Dr Aparajith Ramnath
Assistant Professor 
School of Arts and Sciences, Ahmedabad University                  
⇓
Both scholarly surveys and popular culture suggest that engineering is one of the most coveted educational qualifications, seen as a mark of prestige and a ticket to the good life. But the cult of the engineer in India is much older than the recent, post-liberalization phenomenon involving information technology, software, and outsourcing. In his talk, Dr Ramnath discussed these and related aspects on the emergence of engineering as a reputable profession in colonial India to its modern state of affairs. Engineering began as a stately enterprise in the late 19th century, catering to the infrastructural and administrative needs of the Raj. Civil engineers went on to build railway networks, bridges across rivers, dams, and roads. However, with the onset of the First World War and the Indian independence movement, educational and employment opportunities became available to Indian engineers as well. Training for these engineers happened now in new kinds of institutions, such as TISCO in Jamshedpur, which emerged as nationalist responses to imperial pedagogy in the older colleges. The impetus generated by this transition allowed for engineering to later be seen as integral to nation building, gradually lending the profession the technocratic power which it now enjoys.
Literary Musings: Exploring Fictional Representations of the Partition of India
Monday, 8 March 2021
Dr Rachna Mehra
Assistant Professor 
School of Global Affairs, Ambedkar University Delhi 
⇓
The loss and trauma accompanying the Partition of the Indian subcontinent was dehumanized, banalized, and subsumed in official narratives by appearing in the form of a nondescript inventory of facts and figures populating the pale and redolent leaves of   bureaucratic registers. Literary writers salvaged this rather dismissive numerical representation of the Partition by accepting the gory reality and encapsulating it with precision without falling into the trap of being pretentious or feeling the anxiety to gloss over the obscenity or obnoxiousness of violence. In her lecture, Dr Mehra explored both the effects of Partition and the affect produced by the event by contrasting the recorded memory available in the annals of public domain to those presented in prolific literary form. Referring to Punjabi, Urdu, Bangla, and English writers, she commented on the status of women at that time and explained how women of both India and Pakistan suffered due to the inter-generational violence that characterised the Partition. Arguing that the Partition has somehow been at the heart of every communal conflagration in the subcontinent over the past seven decades, she made a case for a more perceptive, interdisciplinary historical method which would be as at ease with the archive as with oral histories and lived experience.
Psychology in India
Monday, 19 April 2021
Prof Girishwar Misra
Former Head
Department of Psychology, University of Delhi
⇓
Tracing the development of Psychology since its inception in India in 1916 after the first laboratory was established in Calcutta, Prof Misra discussed the flaws of following a strictly positivistic approach in psychological research. He commented on the importance of the human experience as embedded in the cultural context, questioning in effect the universality of psychological constructs. He affirmed that over the past three decades a more rigorous inculcation of this interrogative spirit has led to investigations in the subfield of cross-cultural research and explorations of conceptual and symbolic resources in the Indian thought systems.. The lecture allowed participants to appreciate culture as an open system of meaning and practices, allowing for adaptation and constant reorganization according to the given context.
Eye of the Storm: The Spectator at the Centre of the Sporting-Entertainment Complex
Thursday, 26 August 2021
Dr Vidya Subramanian
Research Affiliate
South Asia Institute, Harvard University
⇓
Analysing spectatorship in contemporary cricket with close reference to the Indian Premier League, Dr Vidya Subramanian critiqued the entertainment aspect of televisual sports coverage. Differentiating between the traditional spectator and the ideal consumer, Dr Subramanian explored the multidirectional fan identity capitalized by televisual broadcast of sport. She argued that IPL fandom can be understood as driven by a consumerist temperament. The annual cricketing festival of India, as it is advertised, the IPL has extended the reach of cricket beyond traditional spectatorship through personality driven market campaigns. It produces a postmodern identity of the non-connoisseur, the ‘everyman as a fan’, which takes a fan and turns her/him into a consumer. She also underlined the role of Information and Communication Technologies in facilitating this transformation through the bringing together of large groups of fans online on social media, the near-continuous engagement of sport and television anchors with content generated by users and fans, such as tweets and Facebook posts, and even the marketing and advertising gimmicks that lure audiences.

Grief Memoirs narrate both individual and cultural mourning and thoroughly examine the nature and process of bereavement and loss. In this lecture, Dr Anirban Halder explores the culture of mourning and the fundamental eloquence of grief through a close reading of Joan Didion’s 
The Year of Magical Thinking
(2005). By focusing on the text’s efficacious use of auto-ethnography, he analysed how losing and grieving loved ones leads Didion to question the meaning of life and death. He engaged critically with Didion’s dilemma to understand contemporary cultures of mourning, especially in post-industrial societies where “life” and “health” are built around the notion of death as a personal failure. He related the importance of memory in the therapeutic healing of grief by referring to Das Kopfkino, Head Cinema. He also pointed out that often this experience of loss, be it of a relationship or of some cherished idea, is interpreted in relation to its various stages, but such categorization still fails to give depth to the specificity of loss.
Posthuman Ecologies and the Unconscious
Tuesday, 26 October 2021
Dr Arka Chattopadhyay
Assistant Professor
Department of Humanities and Social Science
IIT Gandhinagar
⇓
Focusing on Timothy Morton’s concept of the hyperobject, Dr Chattopadhyay foregrounded the notion of coexistence and rhizomatic interrelation amongst humans, nonhumans, and abiotic forms along with the gigantic entities like biosphere and planetary and solar systems which constitute posthuman ecologies. By contextualizing Sigmund Freud’s “uncanny” and the Lacanian knot, he argued that psychoanalysis can be a bridge to ecological thought as the real unconscious—like materially embedded beings and nonhumans—is beyond language and is non-oedipal. He drew analogies between Morton’s concept of nature as a romanticized phenomenon posited as an object out there to be appreciated from distance and Lacan’s notion of “sinthome” or symptom that can apply to a surrounding space. In this manner, he argued that thinking about the environment in the age of Anthropocene has psychoanalytic resonances, with reference to the unconscious enjoyment of climate change deniers in not doing anything about it as well as to the anxiety and trauma produced by environmental disaster. In the concluding part of his talk, Dr Chattopadhyay interpreted the ecological unconscious through Wyl Menmuir’s 
The Many
(2016), which does not straightjacket climate change in literature with genre-fiction but evokes an environmental affect of the uncanny that permeates both ecology and inter-subjective unconscious.
The Case of Exploding Hindi Paperbacks
Friday, 28 January 2022
Dr Aakriti Mandhwani
Assistant Professor
Department of English
Shiv Nadar University
⇓
Focusing on boom in north Indian commercial publishing in the 1950s and 60s, Dr Aakriti Mandhwani talked about the inception of Hind Pocket Books in 1957 and the pivotal role its proprietor D.N Malhotra had in setting a new paradigm for middlebrow literature in Hindi. She argued that Malhotra’s publishing strategy of providing readers with multiple genres encapsulating general reading and maintaining decorum and seriousness around pleasurable reading strengthened the basis for middlebrow readership. The inclusion of literature for everyday consumption with innovative schemes such as the Gharelu Library Yojana defied the inspirational or nationalist preoccupations of the 1920s and 40s, while cheaper paperbacks and multiplicity of genres made Hind Pocket Books a household name amongst the Hindi readership. Dr Mandhwani also pointed out that Malhotra’s trajectory from a printer to an established publisher was made possible through his canny identification of opportunities, whether they were with publishers in the West or with authors and readers at home.        
Integrating Psychology and Economics: On Works of Richard Thaler
Friday, 25 February 2022
Dr Namita Ruparel
Guest Faculty
WILP Division, BITS Pilani
⇓
Focusing on the works of Richard Thaler in Behavioral Economics, Dr Namita Ruparel discussed how Behavioral Economics incorporates insights of human psychology into the models of economic behavior and helps us understand why some models fail to make the correct predictions. The audience was asked to pick choices from given options to demonstrate the “framing effect”, and how it impacts the decision-making of humans. She continued analyzing the concerns of systematic departures from rational choice and elaborated on five biases of human behavior responsible for the incorrect predictions of economic models along with the concepts of Bounded Rationality and Mental Accounting. Exploring the importance of the rational choice model, the speaker seeked evidence from Psychology and Behavioral Economics that put emphasis on testing economic models with real data, enabling them to understand the biases of human behavior and move towards rationality through experimental economics. The speaker concluded her lecture taking insights from the awareness of irrational behavior and rational motivations behind the popularity of the discipline of Behavioral Economics.
Languages of Inequality: Some Thoughts on Practices of Disciplines
Thursday, 07 April 2022
Prof Sowmya Dechamma C.C.
Head
Centre for Comparative Literature
University of Hyderabad
⇓
In order to examine inequalities amongst languages in terms of power structures, Prof Sowmya Dechamma discussed Comparative Literature as a discipline which unpacks the relationship between literature on one hand and other areas of knowledge and belief - such as the arts, philosophy, ethnography, and history - on the other. She commented on the interdependence of translation and Comparative Literature, observing that translation cannot exist without comparison and vice versa. She also suggested that the association between culture/knowledge and power between translation and imperialism can be illuminated through a renewed awareness of the link between transfer of learning and transfer of power. National cultures at large have been consolidated through this process, and the making of Comparative Literature in postcolonial nation-states and its relationship with numerous ‘minor’ languages and ‘minoritized’ people that are made visible within nationalised cultures needs a self-representation and a self-translation that is yet to be done. Prof Dechamma also problematized translation itself and underlined the importance of questioning our everyday use
of language by asserting that no text is entirely original because language itself, in its essence, is already a translation.
Impact of Governance Institutions on Foreign Direct Investment Inflows: Evidence from a Global Sample
Thursday, 29 September 2022
Dr Jagadish Prasad Sahu
Assistant Professor of Economics
Indian Institute of Management Kashipur
⇓
In order to understand the importance of institutions on economic growth, Dr Jagadish Prasad Sahu explained on the impact of economic and political theories postulating on how good quality governance institutions in recipient countries affect Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) inflows. To further explain the argument, he referred to the quality governance institutions and their use of a different form of panel data regression model from data set for 2002-2019. In this regard, he also analysed some important findings related to another control factor apart from the choice variables. The varying inflows of FDI on the basis of political institutions, has become statistically significant for heterogeneous groups of countries with other control variables being natural resources, trade openness, polity and others. Moreover, this lecture mostly focuses on the economic growth of the host countries, trade openness, and resource availability influencing the FDI inflows. Countries with less-capital and/or fewer technology has come up with their economic growth having a clear policy imperative to boost the quality of governance institutions in their jurisdictions to attract more FDI inflows.
Women, Violence and Work: Threat of Sexual Violence and Women&#39;s Decision to Work
Friday, 14 October 2022
Dr Tanika Chakraborty
Associate Professor of Economics
Indian Institute of Management Calcutta
⇓
Analysing the role of sexual violence in workplace on how it affects the participation of women into the workforce Dr Chakraborty critiqued sexual violence against women as a significant deterrent to women’s liberty in all countries arguing that it affects their social choices, and is a contributor in diminishment in their participation in the workforce. Investigating the extent to which the low workforce participation of women can be explained by growing instances of reported sexual crimes against women outside the home in India, Dr Chakraborty established with empirical evidence that for every additional sexual crime in a district, approximately 75 women are deterred from joining the workforce. She found some evidence of heterogeneity across regions and religions, but overall the deterrent effect seems to affect women equally across all economic, demographic and social groups. The lecture also involved analysis of the policies that state and central governments have implemented to increase women’s participation in the workforce, ranging from maternity benefits, childcare support, and tax incentives in employment to protection against sexual discrimination at workplace and alcohol prohibition laws enforced in various states.

International Conference
: Narrating the South Asian City: Critical Perspectives
A multi-pronged interreferencing has been insistently reshaping South Asian cities, informed as much by their shared history of colonisation as by their similar encounters with socio-economic liberalisation and bellicose, entrepreneurial nationalism. This evolving experience of urbanity has altered not just what we say and write about our cities but also how we do so. This conference aims to assess urban writing across genres and forms as it engages with and deliberates on urbanity in this region. It puts together scholarship which is able to complement its deployment of the literary with historical, sociological, architectural, and geographical perspectives.

National Conference: Freedom at Midnight 
: Women’s voices and the Indian freedom struggle
As India observes 75 years of its independence from British imperial rule in 2022, it is fitting to revisit the legacy of our freedom struggle and re-examine the contributions and sacrifices made by persons from all walks of life towards our independence. Needless to say, women were an important part of this multifaceted conceptualisation of freedom throughout the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, and imagined freedom in not just political, economic, and jurisdictional but also social and cultural terms in a deeply gendered manner. This conference intends to bring together scholarship on women’s contributions to the Indian freedom struggle and their self-fashioning in their own works and voices.

Open House of IIT Bhilai at IIT Delhi
Girls in IITs have been around 10%. It has been noticed that not all girls that qualify JEE (advanced) join
one of the IITs. Efforts are being made to support them and address their concerns. IIT Bhilai conducted
an open house for female JEE (advanced) 2018 qualified applicants on 17 June 2018 at IIT Delhi. Dr.
Veena Bansal and Ms. Nikita Shehra, II Year Electrical Engineering were present at the venue from 10
AM till 5 PM. The candidates were excited and anxious at the same time. About 40 girls with their
parents and families interacted with IIT Bhilai team.
Are new IITs safe for girls as these are operating from transit campus? 
Which discipline is good?
Can girls study Mechanical Engineering? 
Should I opt for discipline X in older IITs over discipline Y in newer IITs? 
Should I opt for discipline X in newer IITs over discipline Y in older IITs?
Should I opt NITs/IIITs over discipline X in IITs? 
If I join discipline X, can I change to discipline Y?
If I join discipline X, can I do courses in discipline Y?
IIT Bhilai is a fully residential campus and the girls stay in the hostel that is guarded and has female attendants around the clock. The entire campus is guarded. Every arrangement has been made for the security of all its students.
Mechanical Engineering has emerged in its new avatar in last few years. Girls are studying Mechanical Engineering across the country. IIT Bhilai has girls studying Mechanical Engineering.
All other questions are gender neutral, girls and boys all have to answer these questions for themselves. The best way to resolve these questions is to visit the websites of the relevant Institutes, look at the course curriculum of the programs and faculty profiles to gather information. Visiting institutes under consideration may also provide useful inputs. Contact the students through the mentorship program.
Use all this information to make an informed decision. Avoid making a decision based on the stale information and anecdotal evidence.

IIT Bhilai welcomes its new batch of Postgraduate (MTech and PhD) 
Indian Institute of Technology Bhilai organised an orientation program for its new batch of PG students (MTech and PhD) on July 26, 2020. It is a tradition of the institute to welcome the new students with a week-long orientation program. However, as various face-to-face educational activities have come to a halt due to the pandemic, it becomes practically impossible to conduct such sessions at this moment. Yet, despite these trying times it is gratifying to see that a new journey is about to start for fresh minds. Keeping in mind the COVID-19 advisories, IIT Bhilai organised an online orientation program to welcome students from across the country. 
The orientation program was graced by Prof. Rajat Moona, Director of IIT Bhilai as the chief guest. Dr. Kuldeep Kumar Kataria, Faculty in-charge Students Mentorship Program started the session by his opening remarks. The students were welcomed by Dr. Dhriti S. Ghosh, Faculty in-charge, Student Affairs (DoSA) and Dr. Jose Immanuel R. Faculty in-charge Academic Affairs (DoAA). 
In his inaugural address Prof. Moona said highlighted that IIT Bhilai is one of the first institutes to start its academic programme on time despite COVID19. 
During the first session, Dr. Dhriti S. Ghosh and Dr. Jose Immanuel R. briefed students about life at IIT Bhilai. Updates about the development of the permanent campus were shared by Mr. Srinivas Manem, Assistant Executive Engineer. 
During the orientation the students also had the chance to interact with their mentor students and faculty members via Webex, an online app designed for video conferencing. They were introduced to the various academic departments, Council of Students’ Affairs and health care facilities at IIT Bhilai. The event concluded on a high note with all the new faces aspiring for a successful association with the institute.

Testimonials from the Recruiters
Bosch
“In 2019, we at Robert Bosch Engineering and Business Solutions (RBEI) had an opportunity to host 7 students (from IIT Bhilai Computer Science department) as interns to work in the area of product security. They worked in different security analysis topics ranging from kernel fuzzing, QNX security, SW fuzzing, Linux privilege model, Blockchain, Return oriented attacks on ARM, taint analysis, etc. I have found all of them extremely dedicated and hardworking, and interested to go deep inside a topic with a keen research mindset. I am simply amazed with the amount of result they could produce in such a short time with an extremely high amount of dedication. I hope they have learned something interesting during their internship which would be beneficial for them in general. I wish all of them a very bright and fruitful career ahead. I also wish to have an opportunity to host such an amazing pool of talented students to join us as interns in future years as well from IIT Bhilai.”

“The students have impressed us with their hard work and earnestness. They have been doing great during the internship. One of the student has cracked a bug in a &#39;fuzzy logic&#39; library in the course of his project. This is an open source Python library. The professor concerned has contacted him from a leading South Korean lab and included him in his research group and also to write a research paper with him.  Another student is also rocking and has cracked a difficult prediction problem using Genetic Algorithm... Congratulations to IIT Bhilai”
Jivandeep Health Services
“The experience with the students was terrific.
They showcased utmost diligence towards their responsibilities and qualities of good team players.
It was a pleasure to work with such brilliant minds as they also enabled us to push the bars and contributed towards the overall success and growth of the organization.
I&#39;ll be looking forward to many more associations with IIT Bhilai in the coming future.”

Hon’ble Prime Minister of Republic of India, Shri Narendra Modi laid the
foundation of IIT Bhilai
Prime Minster of Republic of India, Shri Narendra Modi laid the foundation stone of IIT
Bhilai in presence of hon’ble Chief Minister of Chhattisgarh, Dr. Raman Singh on 14 th June,
2018 in a ceremony held at Jayanti Stadium, Bhilai. The ceremony was attended by more
than 1 lakh of people, alongside the faculty members and staff members of IIT Bhilai.
Govt. of India fulfilled the long-standing dream of the people of Chhattisgarh by
establishing prestigious Indian Institute of Technology. IIT Bhilai was inaugurated in August
2016 and is one of the youngest IIT in the country. While IIT Bhilai is currently operating
from the Govt. Engineering College Campus in Raipur, the permanent campus of IIT Bhilai
shall come in villages of Kuthelabhata and Sisra Khurd in Durg district. IIT Bhilai is
expected to move to its permanent campus by 2020. The Government of India has approved
the budget for the first stage of the first phase at Rs. 1082 crore. IIT Bhilai is scheduled to be
developed over three phases. The first phase is planned to have 2500 students. The second
and third phases are scheduled to expand the capacities to 7500 and 12000 students
respectively. The area ear-marked for the development of the campus in the city of Bhilai,
namely the villages of Kuthelabhata and Sirsakhurd are serene, beautiful with natural flora
and fauna, river fronts and other water bodies. The entire campus will be free of pollution and
clean. The construction work of the permanent campus is expected to start immediately after
monsoon in September 2018. The campus is planned to be Griha-5 star rated campus in terms
of sustainability and energy efficiency. The campus is expected to process its own sewerage
to yield zero-discharge, use the alternate form of energy in various ways and use the local
material to make the campus attractive and environment-friendly and reduce the demand of
energy for cooling. The campus is planned to maintain the bio-diversity of the area.

Additive Number Theory (Additive Combinatorics)
Additive Number Theory
, also known as 
Additive Combinatorics
is an active and rapidly developing field of research which is a branch of 
Number Theory
concerning the study of theory of set addition in which the subsets of integers and their behavior under the algebraic operations such as addition and multiplication are studied. More generally, additive number theory includes the study of additive structures of  subsets of (abelian) groups. It has strong interaction with other branches of number theory, combinatorics, group theory, linear algebra, analysis, and many more. To know more about this area, visit the following links:

Title : 
Large Area, Semi-Flexible and Indium-Free Perovskite Solar Cells.
Funding Agency : 
Department of Science and Technology under National Nano Mission Programme.
Duration : 
2019-2022
Summary: 
Abstract: Energy harvesting remains one of the biggest challenges of mankind for the future.
Renewable energy sources, such as solar and wind, need to take up an ever-growing share
of energy demand, which is still largely fulfilled by fossil fuels as of today. For years, solar
cells have been considered as an inferior energy conversion technology due to its stringent
requirements such very costly processing and requirement of skilled manpower for
fabrication. However, recent progress in materials processing and engineering of highly
efficient and stable solar cells have helped them emerge as a frontline renewable energy
technology. More recently, perovskite solar cells (PvSCs) have attracted enormous interest
because they are able to combine the benefits of low-cost, high efficiency with the ease of
processing. In a very short span of time, PvSCs have seen a remarkable improvement with
power conversion efficiency (PCE) shooting up from ~3.8% in 2009 to certified 23.7% in
2018. However, despite their high efficiency, they suffer from long-term stability issues
arising from the rapid degradation of the absorbing perovskite layer failing by far the market
requirements. Also, the high efficiencies were obtained with significantly small cell area, thus
limiting their practical applications. In addition, until now most of the works were
demonstrated on rigid glass with expensive indium metal based transparent electrodes with
little focus on flexibility.
The proposed project aims at development of large area PvSCs with high efficiencies of 12-
15%, and prolong lifetime. The project aims to identify the underlying degradation
mechanism of the encapsulated solar modules containing suitably connected perovskite
solar cells in real world testing conditions.

Title : 
Semitransparent Perovskite Solar Cells for Tandem and Building-Integrated Photovoltaic Applications (SPSC-TBIPV)
Funding Agency : 
Science and Engineering Research Board (SERB), DST
Duration : 
2019-2022
Summary: 
Abstract: The high efficiency of perovskite solar cells (PvSCs) enables us to make them semitransparent with some sacrifice in performance for applications such as building integrated photovoltaics (BIPV) and tandem cell in combination with alternate photovoltaic technologies such as silicon solar cells and CIGS. These semitransparent PvSCs are said to be future elements for BIPV and are increasingly being incorporated into the construction of new buildings as a principal/ancillary source of power. The semitransparent PvSC developed in this project is primarily targeted for window application in buildings. In addition to BIPV applications, via compositional engineering, the band-gap of the PvSCs can be tuned to absorb only specific wavelength of light thus allowing others to pass through it. Such PvSC can be combined with Si or CIGS solar cell in tandem configuration for efficient utilization of solar energy reaching the earth.
Theoretically, an efficiency close to 46.1% has been predicted for perovskite/silicon tandems. For both applications (BIPV and tandem cell), however, the PvSC need a transparent top electrode replacing the conventional opaque thick metallic layer. The main scientific challenges which the projects aim to tackle for realizing semitransparent PvSCs are-

Title : 
Design and Syntheses of Double Frustrated Lewis Pair Systems: A Single Molecule for Double Activation
Funding Agency : 
Science and Engineering Research Board (SERB), DST
Duration : 
2019-2022
Summary : 
Lewis acids and Lewis bases usually form strong adducts. This typical behaviour of electron-pair-donor and electron pair-acceptor compounds was described by Gilbert N. Lewis, who drew the analogy to the H3O+/OH– neutralization reaction in Brønsted acid/base chemistry. Lewis pair adducts exhibit chemistry that is distinct from the original components. This proposal aims to develop double frustrated Lewis Pair (FLP) systems grafted into a single molecule. The newly developed systems will be explored in small molecule activation. Subsequently, they will be tested in homogenous catalytic reactions of small molecules and other relevant transformations. In addition to this, chiral FLPs will be developed which will be tested in asymmetric catalysis reactions.

Contractivity and complete contractivity for finite dimensional Banach spaces and curvature inequalities of the corresponding Cowen-Douglas Bundle. 
Funding Agency :

Duration : 
2019-2022
Summary : 
A contractive homomorphism of the algebra $\mathcal A(\mathbb D)$(respectively, $\mathcal
A(\mathbb D^2)$) dilates to a * - homomorphism of the algebra of the continuous functions $\mathcal C(\mathbb T) $(respectively, $\mathcal C(\mathbb T^2)$) on the boundary $\mathbb T$ as shown by Sz.-Nagy(respectively, Ando). Parrott produced examples to show that contractive homomorphisms of the algebra $\mathcal A(\mathbb D^n) $ need not dilate if n is strictly greater than 2. It was shown by G. Misra that the Parrott examples are not even 2-contractive. It was shown that the study of Parrott
examples is equivalent to studying a class of contractive linear maps on a normed linear space. As
a consequence, it is natural to ask if contractive linear maps on a (finite dimensional) normed linear
space are necessarily completely contractive. Paulsen and E. Ricard have shown that there is

Title : 
Development of Mixed Dimensional Lead (Pb2+) Halide Perovskite (MDHP) Solar-Cells for Clean Fuel Production through Water Splitting
Funding Agency : 
Start-up Research Grant (DST-SERB)
Duration : 
2019-2021
Summary : 
Lead (Pb2+) based 3-dimensional (3D) halide perovskite (HaP) semiconductors with a structural formula of BPbX3, [B = monovalent cation/ methyl ammonium (MA); X=halogen] have received considerable attention because of their potential application in fabricating productive solar cells. The unique and superior photovoltaic property of (3D)-HaP stands for its capability of power conservation efficiency (PCE) above 23%. However, the long-term application of the (3D)-HaPs is getting hindered despite the simplicity of synthesis, expediency in efficiency and notable high performance, because of their instability or atmospheric sensitivity unlike 2-dimensional (2D)-HaPs, which shows better stability but poor efficiency. The limitations of (2D)-HaPs, (A2PbX4; A = long chain organic cation/ butyl ammonium (BA); X = halogen), are due to larger band gap and higher exciton binding energy compared to (3D) HaPs. Now, the question arises, is it a challenge or the priority to find a stable and efficient semiconductor simultaneously?
The project-proposal is endeavoured to design a new mixed dimensional/(2D/3D) halide perovskite (MDHP) and the respective solar cell with improved stability for fruitful photovoltaic or multi-purpose applications in near future. The advantage of molecular modulation will be utilized to modify the design of MDHPs [A2Bn-1PbnX3n+1 (n= 2, 3, 4….. ∞); A= long chain amine; B= methyl amine (MA); X= halide] and to optimize their properties, behavior and interactions in order to achieve the advanced device-performance. Finally, the MDHP-solar cell in conjunction with a photoanode (photocatalyst deposited over fluorine doped tin oxide-FTO coated glass substrates) will be used to generate clean fuel through water splitting reaction under solar illumination.

Time-resolved optical spectroscopy and device applications: Localized metallic state of ZnO and graphene based van der Waals&#39; heterostructure.
Funding Agency : 
Science and Engineering Research Board (Statutory Body Established Through an Act of Parliament: SERB Act 2008), Government of India.
Duration : 
2019-2021
Summary : 
Hybrid materials occupy a special role in numerous optoelectronic applications. Apart from bulk optoelectronic properties, the performance and functionality of these devices depend crucially on the characteristics of the “interface” which modulates the redistribution of both charge and energy under photoexcitation, as governed by the fundamental time-scales. i.e. electronic/excitonic coupling. The electronic coupling between ZnO and graphene makes an important case in the context of Coulombic and van der Waals type interfaces in nanophotonic devices. The intrinsic graphene electronic structure can be modified by introducing a precise strain distribution, localized impurities and others, where we employ ZnO as a substrate to modulate the properties of the graphene and harness the capabilities of hybrid interface. Notably, for both ZnO and graphene, the time-scales are dependent on transient screening and optical excitation density which might yield synergy effects. Also, the energy level alignment between ZnO and graphene plays a crucial role in the transfer of charge from substrate to the adsorbate and vice-a-versa. We believe that this study would unfold the electronic coupling across the interface and the results would be applicable towards photodetectors.

Title : 
Development of Inexpensive Indium-free Organic and Perovskites
Photovoltaic Devices
Funding Agency : 
Science and Engineering Research Board (SERB), Govt. of India.
Duration : 
16 June 2017- 15 June 2022
Abstract: 
The current state-of-the-art 3
rd generation solar cells viz. organic solar cells (OSCs) and
perovskite solar cells (PSCs) are typically fabricated on substrates coated with ITO- indium tin oxide
transparent electrodes (TE). Indium tin oxide (ITO) has been the subject of research and is refined for
over 60 years and as a result, the material offers many beneficial properties that have made it the material
of choice. However, it is widely believed that a shortage of indium (In) may occur in the near future
because of the limited nature of world indium reserves. In addition, the next generation of optoelectronic
devices requires TEs to be mechanically flexible. ITO being an oxide and thick (~150nm), is brittle and
therefore cracks when bended which leads to loss of its electrical properties. As such, the high-cost and
scarcity of indium supply, together with its mechanical constraints has imposed an obstacle for the
successful commercialization of the current solar cell technologies. 
The project intends to address this issue. The main aims are as follows: :
To develop inexpensive and superior indium-free transparent electrodes for energy efficient
optoelectronic devices;
Unravelling the underlying physics of organic solar cells and perovskite solar cells incorporating
developed transparent electrodes using electrical and optical modelling;
To achieve power conversion efficiency of 10+% and 18+% for organic and perovskite solar cells
respectively using developed transparent electrode;
Optimizing interfacial properties and developing new device architectures including organicinorganic
hybrid stratified device;

Title : 
Tunable Coherent Light Sources from the Ultraviolet to the Terahertz, in all Time-Scales.
Funding Agency : 
Science and Engineering Research Board (SERB), Department of Science
and Technology (DST), Govt. of India.
Duration : 
5 February 2018- 4 February 2023
Summary: 
The scarcity of suitable laser gain medium, even after five decades since the
invention of laser, has precluded the access to many regions in the electromagnetic spectrum,
from ultraviolet (UV) to Terahertz (THz), and demanded innovation of new sources by
alternative means. The realization of the potential of nonlinear optical phenomena to provide
coherent radiation has been indeed a major step in the direction of overcoming the spectral
limitations of lasers. It led to the development of optical parametric oscillators (OPOs) that are
potentially capable of providing widely tunable coherent radiations in all time scales
(continuous-wave (cw) to femtosecond). Although, there has been rapid progress in pulsed
OPOs, development of cw OPOs has traditionally remained most challenging due to the low
pump intensities available, high threshold powers and properties such as photorefractive
damages and thermal effects. On the other hand, although there is sufficient nonlinear gain
available in ultrafast OPOs, they require synchronous pumping. As such, for the development of
cw and ultrafast OPOs, that is of great interest for many practical scientific and industrial
applications, proper choice of pump lasers, nonlinear crystals, optimum system designs and
architectures are required.
The research work under this project intends to study new concepts and properties in OPOs
which would pave the way of understanding cw OPOs more fundamentally and would also
contribute in reducing the price and complexity of ultrafast OPOs. Further, implementation of
novel techniques in OPOs together with the advanced nonlinear materials and fiber-laser
technology for the generation of high-power cw tunable output in the UV, and THz, and also
deep-mid infrared (IR) in cw and ultrafast time scale would be explored.
The research programme includes the following main objectives:
Study of fundamental properties such as dispersion in cw OPO
New techniques for generation of ultraviolet cw radiation
Demonstration of deep mid-infrared cw OPO
Generation of tunable cw terahertz radiation
Deep mid-infrared picosecond OPO development
Demonstration of deep mid-infrared femtosecond OPO
The practical realization of OPOs at wavelength beyond 5 m, in the UV and terahertz range
will have significant impact in spectroscopy, trace gas detection, THz bio-sensing and imaging.

“Design and fabrication of perovskite-Si tandem solar cells and flexible perovskite solar cells”
Ref : 
DST/INSPIRE/04/2015/003204 
Duration : 
July 2016 to June 2021
Summary: 
Modern concepts enabling very high efficiencies beyond the single junction Si solar cell limit with
low-cost fabrication are required to make PV technology competitive with conventional energy sources.
Tandem solar cells are a promising route to enhance solar cell efficiencies. The lack of a suitable low-cost
high-efficiency top cell has inhibited the fabrication of c-Si based tandem devices. However, with the
emergence of perovskite solar cells (PSCs), the tandem cell concept has received a major boost. Theoretical
studies have predicted efficiencies far in excess of 30% for c-Si based tandem cells with PSC as the top
cell. Experimental work on this tandem concept has been started by a few research groups in Australia,
Europe and USA in the past 2 years. 
The Si-perovskite tandem architecture is a promising and important concept, considering the
potentially ultra-high efficiencies that are possible with this design. In India, Si solar cells with efficiencies
of 15-17% are available commercially. If the tandem architecture is able to boost these efficiencies beyond
20%, without significant increase in production costs, it will be a great achievement and lower the cost of
electricity from solar PV modules. The perovskite cells can be solution processed on top of Si cells and
therefore, offer a low-cost opportunity to increase the solar cell efficiencies. The present research proposal
is, therefore, important in many aspects. It aims to start the research work on tandem designs in India and
promises to deliver realistic efficiencies &gt;20% for solar cells fabricated by an already established industrial
base in India.

Title : 
“Reversible CO2 Capture by Mesoporous Polymers and its Subsequent Conversion
to Renewable Biodegradable Plastic: A Green Alternative to Petroleum-based
Plastic Bottles and Other Polyester Products.”
Accounting code : 
DST Ref. No.: SB/S2/RJN-113/2016
Summary: 
Most of the previous works dealing with CO2 capture used inorganic mesoporous
materials and suffers from slow capture. On the other hand, most of the plastic
products are made from a polymer called polyethylene terephthalate (PET), also
known as polyester. Each year, around 50 million tons of PET is produced
worldwide for making different items such as fabrics, electronics, recyclable
beverage containers and personal-care products. The starting materials to make
PET are terephthalic acid and ethylene glycol, which are derived from refined
petroleum and natural gas. The use of fossil-fuel feedstocks, added with the energy
required to manufacture PET, generates more than four tons of CO2 for every ton
of PET that’s produced. In situ co-condensation strategy, followed by reversible
deactivation radical polymerization (RDRP, earlier known as controlled radical
polymerization) technique will be utilized to prepare the mesoporous materials.
These studies will enhance our understanding of the mesoporous materials and
will have considerable impact on developing new cost-effective technologies for
CO2 capture and storage. Finally, CO2 will be utilized as a monomer along with
other monomers derived from renewable sources to prepare biodegradable plastic.
By using CO2 that would otherwise be emitted to the atmosphere, the process has
the potential to cut CO2 emissions while simultaneously reducing petroleum
consumption and producing useful products for Indian consumers. The
CO2 containing polymers can be tailored for a diverse range of applications,
including flexible, rigid, and microcellular packaging foams with higher tensile
strength and load-bearing capacity, thermoplastics, and coating resins for food and
beverage cans. This research is truly interdisciplinary and offers a unique
opportunity for us to discuss with recognized scientists from the field of chemistry,
physics and materials science. Such collaboration will significantly enhance the
infrastructure for research and education in the country.

Title : 
Additive manufacturing of a functionally graded coating for diesel engine piston
for environment-friendly application
Duration : 
2018-2020
Summary: 
Functionally graded material (FGM) would provide a gradient of microstructure and properties
along the entire component owing to smooth variation of material composition. Even though a
large number of publications on mechanics of FGM exist, processing of FGM to manufacture
functional engineering components remains an area which requires further research endeavor.
Due to inherent physics involved in laser-based metal additive manufacturing like direct metal
deposition (DMD), it has a great prospect to fabricate FGM components. While these
techniques have gained heightened research attention, in recent times, for processing of
engineering components, there is hardly any attempt to tailor the material composition and
properties using additive manufacturing. 
Direct application of the proposed technology would be in the field of IC engines with reduced
heat loss during combustion processes leading to reduced fuel consumtion, improved thermal
effieciency and exhaust emission. This will finally result in curtailment of warming of ambient
atmosphere and environmental pollution.

Title : 
Development of advanced PVD coatings for machining nickel-based superalloys
Duration : 
2018-2021
Summary: 
Nickel-based superalloys have found widespread applications particularly in aerospace, nuclear,
petrochemical and marine industries. However, owing to low thermal conductivity, high chemical
affinity and presence of abrasive particles in the microstructure, most of the conventional cutting tool
materials suffer from rapid tool wear making the functional requirements of cutting tool more stringent.
Although coated tools primarily based on TiAlN coatings exhibited some improvement in tool life, the
machining industries are still looking for better alternative in order to overcome the problems associated
with machining of superalloys and consequently to augment tool life as well as productivity. The
proposed study aims at developing multicomponent/multilayer coating(s) deposited using advanced
magnetron sputtering technique in an industrial scale deposition system. The proposed study aims at
developing (Ti,Al,Cr,Si)N-based bilayers and multilayer coatings expected to possess high hot
hardness, thermal stability, chemical inertness and good tribological properties. These properties are
essential requirements of cutting tool for machining Ni-based super alloys. The proposed work would
first investigate various physical and mechanical properties of the developed coatings in order to
recommend a suitable coating for machining Ni-based superalloys under dry and near dry environment.

Hybrid Centrality Measures for Service Coverage Problem
,	
International Conference on Computational Data and Social Networks (CSoNet 2019), pp. 81-94. Springer, 2019. 
Service Coverage Problem aims to find an ideal node for installing a service station in a given network such that services requested from various nodes are satisfied while minimizing the response time. Centrality Measures have been proved to be a salient computational science tool to find important nodes in networks. With increasing complexity and vividness in the network analysis problems, there is a need to modify the existing traditional centrality measures. In this paper we propose a new way of hybridizing centrality measures based on node-weighted centrality measures to address the service coverage problem.

An Efficient Heuristic for Betweenness Estimation and Ordering
,	
Social Network Analysis and Mining (SNAM), Springer, 2018. 
Centrality measures, erstwhile popular amongst the sociologists and psychologists, have seen broad and increasing applications across several disciplines of late. Amongst a plethora of application-specific definitions available in the literature to rank the vertices, closeness centrality, betweenness centrality and eigenvector centrality (page-rank) have been the widely applied ones. We are surrounded by networks where information, signal or commodities are flowing through the edges. Betweenness centrality comes as a handy tool to analyze such systems, but computation of these scores is a daunting task in large-size networks. Since computing the betweenness centrality of one node is conjectured to be same as time taken for computing the betweenness centrality of all the nodes, a fast algorithm was required that can efficiently estimate a node’s betweenness score. In this paper, we propose a heuristic that efficiently estimates the betweenness score of a given node. The algorithm incorporates a non-uniform node-sampling model which is developed based on the analysis of random Erdős-Rényi graphs. We apply the heuristic to estimate the ranking of an arbitrary k vertices, called betweenness-ordering problem, where k is much less than the total number of vertices. The proposed heuristic produces very efficient results even when runs for a linear time in the number of edges. An extensive experimental evidence is presented to demonstrate the performance of the proposed heuristic for betweenness estimation and ordering on several synthetic and real-world graphs.

Cumulative VRP: a Simplified Model of Green Vehicle Routing
,	
Sustainable Logistics and Transportation, Chapter 3, 39-55, 2017. 
There has been a recent resurge of interest in vehicle routing problems, especially in the context of green vehicle routing. One popular and simplified model is that of the cumulative vehicle routing problem. In this chapter, we examine the motivation, the definition, and the mixed integer linear program for the cumulative VRP. We review some of the recent results on approximation algorithms for the cumulative VRP. A column generation-based procedure for solving the cumulative VRP is also described. We also review approximation algorithms for a stochastic version of the cumulative VRP.

Cumulative vehicle routing problems are a simplified model of fuel consumption in vehicle routing problems. Here we computationally study, an inexact approach for constructing solutions to cumulative vehicle routing problems based on rounding solutions to a linear program. The linear program is based on the set cover formulation and is solved using column generation. The pricing subproblem is solved heuristically using dynamic programming. Simulation results show that a simple scalable strategy gives solutions with cost close to the lower bound given by the linear programming relaxation. We also give theoretical bounds on the integrality gap of the set cover formulation.

Approximation Algorithms for Cumulative VRP
with Stochastic Demands
,
Algorithms and Discrete Applied Mathematics (CALDAM 2016), pp. 176-189, Springer, 2016. 
In this paper we give randomized approximation algorithms for stochastic cumulative VRPs for split and unsplit deliveries. The approximation ratios are 2(1+α) and 7 respectively, where α is the approximation ratio for the metric TSP. The approximation factor is further reduced for trees and paths. These results extend the results in [Technical note - approximation algorithms for VRP with stochastic demands. Operations Research, 2012] and [Routing vehicles to minimize fuel consumption. Operations Research Letters, 2013].

A Faster Algorithm to Update Betweenness
Centrality after Node Alteration
,
Internet Mathematics, Volume 11, Issue (4-5), Pages 403 - 420, Taylor
&amp; Francis, 2015. 
Betweenness centrality is widely used as a centrality measure, with applications across several disciplines. It is a measure that quantifies the importance of a vertex based on the vertex’s occurrence on shortest paths in a graph. This is a global measure, and in order to find the betweenness centrality of a node, one is supposed to have complete information about the graph. Most of the algorithms that are used to find betweenness centrality assume the constancy of the graph and are not efficient for dynamic networks. We propose a technique to update betweenness centrality of a graph when nodes are added or deleted. Observed experimentally, for real graphs, our algorithm speeds up the calculation of betweenness centrality from 7 to 412 times in comparison to the currently best-known techniques.

An Efficient Estimation of a Node’s Betweenness
,
Complex Networks VI (CompleNet 2015), pp. 111-121. Springer, 2015. 
Betweenness Centrality measures, erstwhile popular amongst the sociologists and psychologists, have seen wide and increasing applications across several disciplines of late. In conjunction with the big data problems, there came the need to analyze large complex networks. Exact computation of a node’s betweenness is a daunting task in the networks of large size. In this paper, we propose a non-uniform sampling method to estimate the betweenness of a node. We apply our approach to estimate a node’s betweenness in several synthetic and real world graphs. We compare our method with the available techniques in the literature and show that our method fares several times better than the currently known techniques. We further show that the accuracy of our algorithm gets better with the increase in size and density of the network.

Routing Vehicles to Minimize Fuel Consumption
,
Operations Research Letters, Volume 41, Issue 6, Pages 576 - 580, Elsevier, 2013. 
We consider a generalization of the capacitated vehicle routing problem known as the cumulative vehicle routing problem in the literature. Cumulative VRPs are known to be a simple model for fuel consumption in VRPs. We examine four variants of the problem, and give constant factor approximation algorithms. Our results are based on a well-known heuristic of partitioning the traveling salesman tours and the use of the averaging argument.

Betweenness centrality is a centrality measure that is widely used, with applications across several disciplines. It is a measure which quantifies the importance of a vertex based on its occurrence in shortest paths between all possible pairs of vertices in a graph. This is a global measure, and in order to find the betweenness centrality of a node, one is supposed to have complete information about the graph. Most of the algorithms that are used to find betwenness centrality assume the constancy of the graph and are not efficient for dynamic networks. We propose a technique to update betweenness centrality of a graph when nodes are added or deleted. Our algorithm experimentally speeds up the calculation of betweenness centrality (after updation) from 7 to 412 times, for real graphs, in comparison to the currently best known technique to find betweenness centrality.

Smart India Hackathon 2020
IIT Bhilai is proud to announce that a team of BTech students has won the Smart India Hackathon 2020 competition on August 5, 2020. The team led by Ashitabh Misra and comprising of Rohit Kar, Smarna Pankanti, Hemant Meena, Shubham Agarwal, and Pawan Kumar designed an Application named Alztech.ai for detecting early-onset of Alzheimer using Spatial Navigation features.
Smart India Hackathon is a nationwide initiative to provide students with a platform to solve some of the pressing problems we face in our daily lives, and thus inculcate a culture of product innovation and a mindset of problem-solving.
The solution presented by the team was an online mobile application that tests a person’s memory, hand-eye coordination, abstract thinking, and spatial navigation skills. They created a 3D path-tracing game that uses Artificial Intelligence to analyze a player’s game playing strategy to identify anomalies and assess the early onset of memory degeneration. Supported by the latest research in academia, they aimed to create the most significant platform in Alzheimer&#39;s research in India.
The team bagged Rs. 1,00,000 cash award along with certificates after battling a challenging 56-hour hackathon. The biggest challenge this time for the participants was that they had to make their contributions remotely and their effort synergised to bring around a futuristic technological innovation forward to help humanity fight a poorly understood chronic neurodegenerative disease that affects millions worldwide.
Smart insulin developed in IIT Bhilai
According to the World Health Organization (WHO), diabetes is one of the leading causes of death and poses a global epidemic in the coming decades. All type 1 and advanced stage type 2 diabetes patients rely on the administration of insulin, a peptide hormone normally secreted in the pancreas and responsible for blood glucose metabolism. Daily inconvenient and painful subcutaneous injection remains the primary route of insulin delivery in such patients. Another major drawback of traditional insulin delivery is the increased risk of potentially fatal hypoglycemia due to premature action. To alleviate these issues, Dr. Suchetan Pal&#39;s group from the department of chemistry in collaboration with researchers at IISER Bhopal and Shiv Nadar University has developed glucose-responsive delivery of insulin for biocompatible hydrogels with programmable insulin release properties. This work is featured in the emerging investigator of 2022 issue of Journal of Materials Chemistry B published by the Royal Society of Chemistry. This issue gathers the very best work from materials chemists in the early stages of their independent careers.

Congratulations to girl applicants for qualifying JEE (advanced) 2022
You must be excited and looking forward to a new chapter of your
life in one of the IITs. These Institutes provide you every opportunity for your all-round
growth. Are you ready for the most rewarding journey of your life at IIT? We are certain you are, IIT Bhilai welcomes you. 
Perhaps you have many questions about IIT system and IIT Bhilai in particular. 
Indian Institute of Technology Bhilai was established in the state of Chhattisgarh by
Ministry of Human Resource and Development in the year 2016. Presently
housed in its transit campus at Government Engineering College (GEC) Raipur,
Chhattisgarh, IIT Bhilai provides on campus hostel accommodation to all its students. The
hostels are guarded around the clock. 
IIT Bhilai has established a 3-D Printing Lab that constitutes an integral part of 3-D Modeling and Design course, a fabrication lab, an electrical lab, a computer lab and a library 
IIT  Bhilai  fosters  and  encourages  students  to  excel  in  their  programs  of  study  and  recognizes the  same  in  all around the development of the students.  It  follows  credit  based  system  of  education.  Under  this  system,  a student needs to complete the credit requirements for the courses. There is a prescribed nominal duration of the program while the students may complete in lesser time or may invest more time to move to the next higher level of system. IIT Bhilai offers the following programs
in the undergraduate system.
BTech: 
The  nominal  Bachelor  of  Technology  degree wherein  a  student  is  admitted as per the admission process
BTech  (Honours):
The  enhanced  Bachelor  of  Technology  degree  wherein  a  student admitted  to  a  BTech  program  may  choose  to  carry  out  additional  courses/project in his/her  own  discipline  or  another  discipline.  BTech  (Honours)  is  a  program  where students are not admitted initially but may opt to convert their BTech program.
These programs are offered in five disciplines, namely,
Computer  Science  and  Engineering 
Data Science and Artificial Intelligence
Electrical Engineering 
Mechanical Engineering 
Mechatronics 
IIT Bhilai follows a fractal system of academic courses. In this system, a semester is divided into 
six fractal segments. A course offered by the Institute can run over multiple consecutive fractal 
segments. The  fractal  system  of academics  facilitates  wider  choices  of  electives  for  building  breadth  as  well  as  depth,  offers flexibility,  fosters  modern  interdisciplinary  education,  and  encourages  research  early  in  the program.
The campus has sports facilities (basket ball, badminton, football, table tennis, snooker etc.), gym, recreation room and music room. 
You may have constraints, concerns and questions. You can visit the 
IIT Bhilai website
for more details. You are welcome to contact the team for any query, small or big, academic or non-academic, financial or residential. Hope to see you at IIT Bhilai.

Designing a Propellane-based Nonlinear Optically Active System Absorbing in Three Different Wavelength Regions
Researchers in the Department of Chemistry, IIT Bhilai, has developed a theoretical model for the class of molecular system that can absorb light in three different wavelength regions. The class of molecule, we are talking about, has a very nice three-blade propeller-like structure. The research group working under Dr. Mehboob Alam have found that the molecule can be modified in different ways to expand the range of wavelength in which light-absorption can be achieved. Such molecules are promising candidates in material science such as development of primary color emitters for LED displays, which is used in smart devices such as smartwatches, smart TVs, mobile phone displays, tablets etc. They have further showed that such molecules may also have good non-linear optical properties which may be explored for applications in advanced fields like 3D microfabrication, lithography, and so on. This, however, requires an extensive test at both theoretical as well as experimental levels. The relevant article is published in the Chemistry Europe Wiley-VCH journal ChemPhysChem.

Prof. Ravindra Pandey, a physics Chair at Michigan Technological University with his expertise in Computational Materials Physics delivered a lecture IIT Bhilai Campus on 27th November 2018.
Prof. Pandey unravelled the experimental as well as theoretical aspects of nanomaterials as he covered zero-dimension quantum dots, one dimension nanotubes, two dimensional nanoribbons and 3 D materials. He is the man of material modelling, and gave the idea to beginners how to model any property of nanomaterials and correlate it with experimental analysis. He emphasized that the material modelling has enough accuracy using suitable approximation which can help experimentalist to predict the properties of material before fabrication of electronic optoelectronic and electrochemical devices.
The talk was quite informative, and brought together innovative academicians and industrial experts in the field of material science and Nanotechnology to a common forum.
Outreach 2018
“Teachers Training Program” - Workshop for High School Teachers 
Science has become an important and indispensable part of our daily lives. Science has made each and every aspect of our daily living easier, faster and safer. Science teaches us to ask the most fundamental questions “what, how and why” of nature and is the reason for the ever increasing understanding that people have about the world around them. It is therefore important to educate the teachers about the recent developments in science and technology. Indian Institute of Technology Bhilai (IIT Bhilai), a premier educational Institute in the country, actively engaged in quality research and teaching believes in creating such awareness.
Teachers Training Program has been organized by IIT Bhilai in collaboration with State Council Education and Research Training Chhattisgarh and supported by Royal Society of Chemistry. Around 45 teachers are selected from different parts of Chhattisgarh to attend the program which is being held during May 08 - 09, 2018 at IIT Bhilai, GEC Campus, Raipur, 492015, Chhattisgarh.
The aim of the Teacher Training Program is to give teachers contemporary tools for delivering effective and engaging chemistry lessons. Teachers are introduced to proven active learning techniques that can be applied easily in a chemistry context, helping students develop their knowledge and enthusiasm for chemistry. They will practice using these techniques in their lessons plans. Teachers also explore some key science topics in depth, learning about the misconceptions students may hold and how they can be tackled in the classroom. Finally, teachers get the opportunity to try some practical chemistry experiments which can be adapted to be used in any settings, including those with no traditional laboratory facilities. The program has been designed to create harmony between learning and applying scientific knowledge towards the development of the society with a mission to foster a new generation of teachers who are inspired to improve the world with Science.
We hope to provide all the participants with the best possible scientific experience.

The weeklong programme had informative video presentations, poster competitions and a vigilance quiz for all, with the aim of raising awareness about the significance of ethical conduct in the building of an honest, non-discriminatory and corruption free society. Posters were stuck on the campus walls to motivate everyone present towards adopting best practices.
During the concluding session Mr. M Awasthi, Deputy General of Police, Raipur addressed the gathering over webex and said that systemic changes in procedures, minimal discretion, reduced public interface, technology-based procurement and automation will go a long way in reducing corruption. During his address Prof. Rajat Moona, Director, IIT Bhilai emphasized disciplined behaviour and inner consciousness is the foundation for ethical behavior and all human beings should follow these which will help in nation building.”
This vigilance awareness week at IIT Bhilai is a campaign that affirms our commitment to the promotion of integrity and probity in public life through citizen participation.
VIGILANCE AWARENESS WEEK
Vigilance Awareness Week was observed in IIT Bhilai on the theme 
Eradicate Corruption - Build a New India 
from 29th October to 3rd November 2018.
Vigilance Awareness is an initiative as per the directives of Central Vigilance
Commission to raise awareness to maintain integrity, transparency,
accountability in all practices for a corruption-free environment in the
organisations.
This year’s theme- 
Eradicate Corruption - Build a New India 
is a measure to promote ethical business practices and foster a culture of honesty and forthrightness for good corporate governance. Corruption prevailing at all levels – economic, social, administrative, moral and spiritual has defaced the image of our nation beyond redemption.
Professor Rajat Moona, Director IIT Bhilai inaugurated the Vigilance Awareness Week on 29th October. The faculty and staff members commenced the programme at institute by taking the integrity pledge, led by the Director Prof. Rajat Moona.
In pursuance with the vigilance week a talk was delivered by Shri. S. N. Sharma (DSP, Central Bureau of Investigation Raipur), Shri. Manas K. Gupta (DGM-Vigilance, Bhilai Steel Plant) and Shri. Anand K. Singh (AGM-Vigilance, Bhilai Steel Plant) on 1st November 2018 to sensitize all employees towards ethical business practices. 
The speakers emphasised on the various vigilance measures adopted and suggested changes to prevent such misconducts and appreciated the efforts by IIT Bhilai in spreading the vigilance amongst its stake holders
On this occasion several Outreach activities like Skit Performance, elocution was organised. The students of IIT Bhilai presented a satirical skit showing the day-to-day shortcomings of authorities to provide basic civic amenities to its citizens. It also dealt with the issues of corruption at different levels in our society and the public&#39;s peaceful revolution against corruption.
The weeklong awareness campaign at IIT Bhilai was an effective measure to
foster a culture of honesty and integrity for good corporate governance for the
welfare of our society.

Author Workshop organized by Wiley at IIT Bhilai
On 5th December, 2018, ‘Wiley’ organized ‘Authors Workshop’ at IIT Bhilai
‘Wiley’ is one of the largest publication house in the world, serving as a key resource of knowledge for more than 200 years. The ‘Wiley’ publications are helpful for research community in various disciplines across the world. As a premier educational Institute in the country, IIT Bhilai is actively involved in research activities in many areas of Science and Engineering. On behalf of ‘Wiley’, Mr. Yateendra Joshi, Mr. Rahul Dasgupta, and Mr. Nitheen Patric were present at IIT Bhilai to conduct the ‘Author Workshop’. 
Mr. Suyash Kandele (PhD student) welcomed the ‘Wiley’ team, all the faculty members, students and staff members. Prof. Rajat Moona gave an inauguration speech, were he briefly discussed about the importance of Journal publication and how scientific publications evolved in the past few years.
Mr. Yateendra Joshi conducted the workshop on behalf of ‘Wiley Publication House’. Mr. Joshi, who worked as a scientist at ICAR, NCL, IISER, is a member of the editing office, Automium Culture (Brussels) and member of the Editorial Board of Information Design Journal. Mr. Joshi discussed about the critical steps towards writing a manuscript including: 
• How to structure a manuscript
• How to select a journal and prepare a submission package
• How to respond to reviewer comments
The workshop was an important and beneficial event for the research scholars and M.Tech students of IIT Bhilai, who are already engaged in doing research. The workshop was co-ordinated by Dr. Satyajit Gupta. 
International Women&#39;s Day
IIT Bhilai celebrated International Women&#39;s Day on campus. Keeping in mind this year&#39;s theme a caption writing competition was organised on the theme “choose to challenge&#34;. All the female faculty and staff participated enthusiastically in this competition. 
The event began with a talk by Ms. Hao-Yu Lu, the Chinese Language Instructor at IIT Bhilai.  Having worked across countries, Ms. Hao-Yu Lu shared the various challenges that she has observed faced by women and discussed some of the ways to tackle these challenges. 
The chief guest of the occasion, Mrs Rajni Moona, former IT Head at IITBNF, gave an inspiring speech reiterating that women have to come out of their comfort zones and challenge their limits to be on a par with men. Dr. Dhriti Sundar Ghosh, Associate Head, Department of Physics, also spoke on gender equality and said that the world must change the way we perceive women and appreciate their invaluable contribution. 
The session concluded with a video discussion on this year&#39;s theme and a token of appreciation was given to all female employees as an expression of gratitude for their relentless commitment. 
World Environment Day 
World Environment Day is celebrated on June 5 every year to celebrate the importance of nature. It is held across the globe to remind people that nature must not be taken for granted but respected for all its values. On the occasion of World Environment Day this year, IIT Bhilai in collaboration with Nature and Healthcare Welfare Society &amp; the Gram Panchayat of Sejbahar in Raipur conducted a plantation drive around the pond next to its transit campus. 
The event began at 07:30 am in the presence of Prof Rajat Moona, Director of IIT Bhilai, Dr Padam Jain, Smt Anita Sahu(Sarpanch, Sejbahar), and Mrs Rajni Moona. The institute aims to restore the natural beauty of the area and has planned to plant more than 250 saplings. The plantation drive focuses on the sustainability of plant and wildlife, and to ensure this, a metal tree guard is    provided for each of the saplings. In order to simultaneously foster a culture of responsibility towards nature, each of the trees have been adopted for conservation by the institute and the Sejbahar village. 
Shri Virendra (CEO, Janpat Panchayat, Dharsiva), Shri Satish Kothari, Shri Ashish, Ms. Divya and Gram Panchayat members of Sejbahar along with faculty and staff members of IIT Bhilai actively participated in the event. The initiative also saw participation of nature lovers from Raipur who supported this novel intent of increasing the green cover around the beautiful GEC campus of Sejbahar.
The preparations for the tree plantation drive were diligently carried out by Mr. Devi Prasad Sarangi and Administration Department of IIT Bhilai. While the event was very well attended, everyone present adhered to all the Covid-19 Safety protocols, making it a great success.
